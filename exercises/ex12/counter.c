/*
2. The final value of the counter is correct because the total number of times
   the counter is incremented is equal to the NUM_CHILDREN. Also, the threads
   or the operation in this code is atomic.

3. This is an example of the output of ./counter:

    counter = 0
    counter = 0
    counter = 0
    counter = 3
    counter = 0
    counter = 5
    counter = 5
    Final value of counter is 7

   From the printed values of the counter not incrementing one by one,
   concurrency of the threads can be observed. This behavior is due to some of
   the threads printing the value of the counter variable before the increment
   or after the increment. In the case where we want to see the exact counter
   value for each iteration, this would be considered as a synchronization error
   which can be resolved with semaphores, mutexes, or condition variables.
